# Ladybug Tools Swagger/OpenAPI Specification

This repo is a first pass at setting up a swagger/openapi specification for ladybug-tools python packages.

There are currently two versions of the specifications:
* openapi 3 - Is written using the OpenAPI 3 specification
* swagger 2 - Is written using the Swagger 2.0 specification

The easiest way to check what the specification looks like or to make changes is to copy the `spec_api.yml` file and paste it into the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)

The Swagger Editor can also be used to generate Server or Client packages in multiple languages. At the moment there are more language options for Swagger 2.0. Any generated Client/Server can be found under the `swagger 2/Clients` or `swagger 2/Servers` folders.
